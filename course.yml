title: Using Python for Research
author_field: ctphoenix
description: This course bridges the gap between introductory and advanced courses
  in Python. While there are many excellent introductory Python courses available,
  most typically do not go deep enough for you to apply your Python skills to research
  projects. In this course, after first reviewing the basics of Python 3, we learn
  about tools commonly used in research settings.\nUsing a combination of a guided
  introduction and more independent in-depth exploration, you will get to practice
  your new Python skills with various case studies chosen for their scientific breadth
  and their coverage of different Python features.This consists of the homeworks for
  each week.
